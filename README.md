# Pointers in VR
In this project, a user will be able to learn how pointers work. The program will be based in an immersive, 3D space, that the user will be able to navigate in VR, using their phone and a simple VR viewing device like Google Cardboard. The user will be able to perform various actions like creating pointers, selecting different pointers, moving them around, and so on with the use of buttons that will be present on a controller that they will connect to their phone via Bluetooth. They will have 3 degrees of freedom in terms of movement. The project will be coded using C# and rendered using Unity Engine. Within the program, the user will be able to interact with different pointers (represented by arrows*) and move them around, selecting which memory address to store within them. The user will have to correctly execute the actions of the pointers based on whichever algorithm or function is selected. If the user makes a mistake in the action of the pointers, the program will show an error message, and explain why what the user did is wrong. The program will keep a scoreboard of how many steps were taken correctly, and how many mistakes have been made, and present a sense of progression in learning about pointers
